# Oraxen Configuration Generator

Generate item configuration files with ease! Coded as a solution to avoid the hassle of copy-and-pasting a template or worse -- writing it out new each time (who does that?!).

## Use
1. Download oraxenconfiggen.py.
2. Open up the file and change values that have "# CHANGE" next to them. You can also edit the templates to your liking, but it's not required.
3. Run the program using "py oraxenconfiggen.py"
4. Click "Open Folder" and open the folder that holds the target models
5. Click on each model and indicate if they should be sittable or not.
6. Click "Generate Configuration File" and choose the name of the file (w/o '.yml'), the starting custom model data number, and finally, the file where the config should go (ideally plugins/oraxen/items)

## Future Plans
In the future, this generator will be completely configurable from the very start without having to interact with the code.

Enjoy!
